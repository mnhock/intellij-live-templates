# IntelliJ Live templates

This project is a collection of my small tutorials on using Live Template variable functions, and also contains some IntelliJ Live 
templates for various Java libraries.

## How to add them?

You can assemble the templates manually on IntelliJ's **Settings > Editor > Live Templates** panel.

## Contribution and support

If you find any issues in any of the templates, you have a suggestion or request, you found a useful JetBrains support ticket, please create a GitHub issue in this project.
